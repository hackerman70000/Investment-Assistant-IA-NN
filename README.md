# Prophet: Investment Assistant Neural Network

## Overview

Prophet is a neural network-based system designed to predict stock market trends. It leverages historical data, technical analysis, and machine learning to forecast price movements and assist in investment decisions.

## Usage

Prophet can be run both locally and in cloud environments such as *Google Colab*. The project includes two Jupyter notebooks:

- `train.ipynb`: Use this notebook to train the model.  
- `predict.ipynb`: Use this notebook for making predictions.

After training, you can push the trained models to your private repository and utilize them for prediction.

## Components

### Scrape

The scraper fetches stock data from the Binance API. It supports daily and monthly data retrieval, features multi-threaded downloading for improved performance, and optionally verifies file checksums for data integrity.

### Train

The training component consists of two main classes: `Preprocessor` and `Trainer`.

- `Preprocessor` loads and prepares data with technical indicators, creates target variables, splits datasets, and applies scaling and PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- `Trainer` builds and trains the neural network model, implements early stopping to prevent overfitting, evaluates the model on test data, and saves the trained model along with its configuration.

### Predict

The prediction component downloads real-time market data, preprocesses it consistently with the training data, loads the trained model, makes predictions, and reports results including target prices.
